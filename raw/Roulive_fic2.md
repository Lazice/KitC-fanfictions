When the door opens, there are chattering in the hallways. Mingling workers lurk their whispers underneath hushed breaths, as they watch Olive stride through the court's hallways. Confident in his walk. The concrete grounds lay a single path out of the castle, outside into the woods. Two wooden benches either side, day and night, their stomachs to the sky. Blurred were the wooden gates that works by a handman. 
"Could I?"Â 
_"Name and suit?"_ 
"Olive, Diamond candidate." 
Slowly, the burly handman turns away from it, detaching their gaze off it last as they'd go to unlock. The door swings open with with a creek, the cobble grounds accent the flourishing, cold Autumn.

... They walk through the warm greenery which surrounds them. A hand clutching tightly to the key. To however they take no mind to the solace as the wind climbs vivid, when the clouds seems just lower to them, than before.

The way the hill rises above, higher than the trees, just slightly higher than the castle beneath.   How time steals away from life...

A pale figure stands beneath the looming evergreens. As kir white hair almost glows, upon the way that the afternoon sunlight glazes kir presence. Ki seems calm. The way that the cold of winter seems to have came early, the way kir blue eyes meets theirs.

"Sorry for having you come all this way."

They nod, as it seemed important for kime. Calmer, less irritated than last week; the isolation from all did them some good.
> [they seem calm, less generally less irritated than before. The isolation did them some good.]

"Are you alright? Is it about the memorial? "

"I don't think so, no.. Um..."

Roulx's hair is unkempt, its eyes, looking to the side, are glazed over with a shade of exhaustion. He leans back on his heels, relaxing for this polite being, patient. 

> ... It's not the memorial I guess, but I don't think I'll be appearing to that memorial anyways... [Swaying itself, its eyes half opened.] I guess that you'll be fine with me staying over for sometime?...

"... I don't think it's the deaths. But. I guess I won't be appearing at the memorials."

They fidget with their hands, long, nimble fingers intertwining like a play. As they look to the side then back to Olive. 

"It seems... Would you be fine if I stayed over for sometime?" 

It sways, slower than the wind. Frail under the warm light, he responds by his gaze, a nod, he replies. The hand which grasps the key raises to its view.

"You seem in need of a break from.. whatever is happening. It must be a lot."

"Thanks... I owe you one after this,, untimely event." 

"No worries, we've got plenty of space. Come along." 

As the keys to the Diamonds' now has a new accessor, he smiles as he walks
