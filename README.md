# KitC Archive About
### note:
Hi yeah this repostitory was originally just for Roulive fanfic, but I'm writing more. So, why not I archive here too.
Made by me, and other people if they want to.

There's two types that I'm storing them in. 
1. They were uploaded to AO3 too, so I downloaded in their **PDFs**.
2. **MarkDown**  This is because I silly... And sometimes reading PDFs are a little annoying =w=. Also I found some texts that aren't really on AO3 and I... ya.

Also there's a 3rd folder. It's for storing Work In Progresses. Called wips.
