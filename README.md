# KitC Archive About
### note:
Hi yeah this repostitory was originally just for Roulive fanfic, but I'm writing more. So, why not I archive here too.
Made by me, and other people if they want to.

There's two types that I'm storing them in. 
1. They were uploaded to AO3 too, so I downloaded in their **PDFs**.
2. **MarkDown**  This is because I silly... And sometimes reading PDFs are a little annoying =w=. Also I found some texts that aren't really on AO3 and I... ya.

Also there's a 3rd folder. It's for storing Work In Progresses. Called wips. 

## MarkDown. How I format.
MarkDowns. Each fic would be appropriately named with their Title in the file name.
1. Who it's written by
2. Fic Title
3. Fic warnings
4. Summery
5. Tags
6. Date Last Updated. Year/Month/Day

There may also be additional notes marked with an asterisk ( * ). All Author's notes will be noted with the > before the text, going under their each sections.
