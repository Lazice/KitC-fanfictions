# He Sinks His Teeth into the Ones He Loves The Most

  `Rapid POV switching.`  `questionable past/present/future tense use.`  `I am making everything the fuck up` 

Leaking from above his skull, the impact bled silver, trailing down his head; spiking, and foggy that made his vision. The stars that ae saw, smelt like the atmosphere they would be (theoretically) surrounded by, it's aer blood after all. One that ae's grown familiar to too long ago, for far too long. 

Ae wonders, walking down another recently known maze, the veil has grown from mycelial, parasitical. Closing his eyes. The writhing holy, scent speaks to aer skin, as if ae had a true human skin that tightened. This disgusting assume that painted themselves unique to each path. Zoran follows the one he's well acquainted with. That most painful; that(,) he knew. Not because it is the most horrible, but for how much it is personal.

They gave no acknowledgement to him when he came back to this cold environment. Same arrangement of rooms and halls, that only gave guessing room to those, that'd never return.

The Doctor raised an alert gaze to his intrusion, the wrong door, but it was the one closest for aer. She'd only frown, returning to operate at the seeming bloody mess that laid on the operating desk, while jars of red and black surrounded them. This mess, irked him. Growing, his head in a daze, the blood entering carelessly into his squinted eyes, unable to identify whom, or what, or where, the person that laid on the operating table.

\-

She awoke. The bright operating lights shining down on her, at this moment, she knows she shouldn't move. Well really, she couldn't move.

"Stay now, stay still." Her voice commanded like a curse to her, she stilled more silent that her heart would even cease. Every machination in her that churned stilled to a halt, all which recognised their creator. She kept her gaze to the light, they that burnt in her retinas as the posite glow, whenever her eyes gave up and flicked to the darkness. She couldn't feel anything beneath her neck, assuming the worst.

But she could hear, as the engineer's hands stilled for a moment, and the fumbling of distraught shoes clacked into the room. She looked over, unmoving in every part except her eyeballs. Out of the corner of her vision, there a figure with white hair and purple lurched over and clattered to the ground. In her calculations, she would feel bad for this instance, perhaps panic and tell her surgeon to assist the person that has just collapsed in this very room.

"He'll live."

Luci, doesn't move.

Dr Moiras, doesn't move. Except  to her subject, quickly continuing with her clattering, picking up and putting down her metallic instruments, sewing and tinkering with her body, her organs. Luci couldn't fear, that trait is far too useless in this place. Her *own* instruments currently out of touch and out of control. The false safety this sanctity of a metal bed gives her, is temporary, is juvenile.

The smell of ozone, a stench in the air that seemed to have grown somehow, more pungent with the particular strain that her little not-friend has intruded in with. He laid there, staining an already contaminated vinyl floor. Aer mother hummed as she operated on someone else.

\-

A sharp pinning pain, he's restrained to the operating table. Where the force by futile struggling pulled at the metal bindings. His perpetrator, using the most effective step, one her cold gloved hand clutched around his neck. More of a threat to his nerves as his scream came unheard by the cold realisation.

"The cost of anaesthetics are heavy in resource, I'm sure you'll keep quiet with the amount of experience you have, won't you?"

That gave aer the forewarning, that didn't stop the future from happening. As without a response in time, ae felt the scalpel cut through the cheap strings that held his neck to the rest of his body. His doctor caressed his head as he watched as she held it up to the light, and felt. The wires that hung loose out of his neck cavity, they that stretched and curled around each other. Worthless little contraptions that worked like wonder and purpose on those that weren't him.

He felt the tapping on his skull, cold liquid flowed out of the wound. All too close to his own other sensors. Having learnt many times from the times before, but this time, she stayed silent. The Doctor laid her gaze at the fractals made from the impact wound.

"Are you finding anything mom?" He asks, the room is no colder than he remembered.

"No, I won't. Do you want me to find anything then?"

"... Probably." Even Zoran questioned what he wanted to say. He thought about whether it was something else rather than this. Wouldn't he know, it was just his mom's work job, for,, whatever. Besides, it always ends in the end. It all ends with something of his being lost. But always, he'll be good again. That is his mom after all.

Dr Moiras worked her way through. Modifying the flesh of other organisms ae'd probably helped to bring here, nowadays she has more efficient workers for this duty. But, ae guessed that it's probably due to the time that aer mom had spent on him, that effort, that she hasn't left him yet... Darkening over, maybe it's something fearful, in the fragments that she had bestowed in an amalgamation to him. Something, it's something over him. Something within him, a hole having ebbed away at his future.

These unfamiliar pieces, stored in their dark jars and vials. Most of them labelled with names, few he now recognise. Horrible with the name that's corruption, or one that reminds him of that, sinks into his view, his vision still blurred and speckled by the contamination.

"I see. Your skull was nearly shattered, if not for how it's built into sections. Contaminated fractals, blunt force by a feral entity... I expected better from you." Sat through the examination, he tried to focus on her words, though they had also begun to disintegrate from aer mind as soon as they came into his ears.

Through the haze, he was operated on. It's hard not to empathize with the price being paid, Whose body parts are they... 

\-

A ticking clock, previously unnoticed by the two patients in this room.

Yes the patient number grew,, involuntary of the doctor's will. However, it is more effective currently for me to finish with this current subject. She would prove to be give more value than the one on the ground. Luci really have outdone herself out there. For that time, acquired herself another partner, a partner of even a stranger physique. O-07831 with their well developed combat abilities. The scar on my wrist was a decent mark of his now capabilities.

She hummed as her hammer-tapped the binding staples to the ceramic pieces, affixed onto Luci's pre-existing body parts. Her face, still patchy with the beauty of stained glass and her crackling and blood.

Really, this isn't a great time to have two important units injured. Not that Zoran is an important unit, he is just one.

Enough monologuing, I would suppose that you've seen enough to know without me going through everything again. Let's make this easier.

\-

He awakes with not his kidney missing. No, he now jokingly doubts that he had them in the first place, being a boy of toy afterall. With even all the knowledge that anyone else around him, still strives to get more (successfully so even).

Not really. He is still in the same room as when he'd went to sleep. On the same bedding that hurts much more than the visions in his dreams. Zoran questions for why she'd removed part of memories for him, but not the part where she would hurt him. He sits up, his body's moving seem to creak. It is more a confused feeling albeit, nothing more.

Technically repaired, he ignores the jars of something seemingly looking down at where he once laid. Getting to the floor, and wrapping and buttoning up his clothes. He turns off the lights, and leaves to stray outside that now dormant operating room.

It's a familiar hallway that grants no comfort.

Sounds of his step transitions from the soft half latex-plastic tacky floor-covering, to the now clinking stiffness of the hard glossy tiles beneath his feet. The lights are dim outside, in their nightly powersaving mode, the red light blinking careful, casting a crimson shadow shape of his mis-shapen suit and self to the floor. One where when he looks, he notices another figure to his right. Leaned against the door and her arms crossed in front of her chest, not hard to recognise a figure too familiar in visions more than memories.

She stares at Zoran cold, questioning; her smallest movements of lifting her chin to feign confidence.

"What?"

Her voice is different. Not *different* different, her voice was still her voice, the same texture of sounds. But, it isn't the one which he'd spied on times before behind mirrors and windows, used to be more chirpy and willing. Cold? And he knows why, and he wants to comfort her. By him, comfort her unfortunate frozen up soul in a place already too cold.

"Why are you here Luci?" And aer grin was too crooked, his hands too cold against himself.

"Why can't I?" She smiles back.

There's a time where ae would simply smile and skip away, waving Luci away in that same jolly prance as if ae expects Luci to chase aer. Yet ae is frozen.

Luci tilts her head to the side, glancing to the wall behind him. "Nothing. That's alright." Ah, she walks away. So Zoran was the one dumbfounded in front of Luci, of course he is. He was scratching at the inside of his collars when he watched Luci walk away without any explanation.

He brushes his fingers through his hair, trying to find some semblance of comfort in that static touch, buzzing in bare fresh seal just under his skull. He walk after where her place left a trace of shadow in still this darkness. He wants to figure out what had gone wrong, he's so scared of wanting to know what had gone wrong, it, he's afraid that what was wrong was him. And he feels like that would be unavoidable and he wants to try for it to not be and he wants it to be okay and he wants.

.

He's standing in the middle room of the Hearts Tower. There are boxes with fingerprints on their clear tape seals, the ringing in his hearing spring down the brick and paint halls, dry stalls and pried locks. Well, no. It's darker. The only light sources gleam dimly each from the mirrors, windows and other reflective surfaces.

Zoran looks around the space, where there sat beds and spokes of harsh intimacy, laid only a shape of couch and bedding. He can tell this time, it's vividly his neck hurting, the cervical spinal cord 3 that rests out at the back of Zoran's neck. In an almost awkward position, he scratches at the back of his neck, glancing to each the previously been furniture. Where there's left, are simply layered, silhouetted dust ground. Aer feet kicks, making dust clouds and trailing his shoes through them.

The light shining softly from even the tape and mirrors stuck to the wall with nails and knife marks, he doesn't look too close. Even if he knows that no one else. Is. In here.

With his back towards the glow, what casts over his face is less neutrality, shadows that bound him here again for reasons that are seemingly in his control. Sure, this time he came back here on his own will, to investigate just what happened. But what he finds, answer barely any of the questions.

It's like the previous residents within this castle had all simply, moved out. The royals' rooms above are deserted more than the Guestrooms where the other ace candidates had lie (verb(verb)). Wading through the darker rooms after rooms, ae gazed through the mirrors and watched behind aer. Emptiness shrouded all corners, but not loneliness. No. There's the bleached wood that's been walked over so many times before, the fingerprints and trash that belonged to someone so personal. He watched at each the evidence that float to his vision, colourful and the colourless else, and so different were them to him (outsider).

Not leaving any imprints of his own, in such a tender environment is impossible. Even if you're god(and it seems like even the gods have left here). So he simply took what he wanted(evidence) and left little trace (that he's sure no one else would find). Enough to take, a small layer of dust blown up by his movement had gathered on himself as well. 

Wtihin his haze of passing thoughts, one mocked aer behaviour, leering for whether what he's doing is worth it for what it's expected to be. To see a reasoning to Luci, and why... She came back. Well, it fits him then. Nothing of worth so. Maybe this is some kind of playful salvage something together from what ae remembers, for however long that place had sat dorment and ae'd simply watched from behind windows.

A theatrical mock of symbolica card laid within the kings' rooms. Each the king of each suit. He simply gathered them from where they'd sat when he'd came in for, placing them as care-off,-hand into aer pockets. 

Unknowing to aer, the one the diamond king, swept away like the wind out amongst the time he'd leave the place with supposedly everything that ae needed. He doesn't need him anyways. The others complain about none. Too because they can't.

Ae return home, with less of the same dread as when ae'd returned home with nothing much of the days when he's scared. When he came back, a scarlet hue wavered around him which he'd waved away too goes winds. 

Grows that a small part of him expected for aer mother to comment on his, something. The thought of that, even if as expected negative, squeezes in a warm sort of affection in aer. One fantasy he rides off of tone tongue around his steps so gile. Where it lurked and warmed a bit of the coldness, he'd find a table amongst the mess to place down more to the mess. 

Most which, was something for aer in desperate to gather, keep hopelessly safe somehow here. It's as if this place is anymore safe than even just the outdoors, just a different kind then.

Ae splayed out the items on the table, beginning to construct some sort of story within it all... Some... Some kind...

... Chapter 2.

> begin 27th April 2024

The morning came and Cecilia is pondering about the tools and hands that she has under her hands. If with the theories that she already knows at hand, what would be a more interesting approach to dealing with the current environmental structure she lives under? 

Leading their noses around like cattle and sheep, have grown tedious. Where the beauty of evolution came to bloom in result of her letting them go wild again. With restraints of course. She is yet still recording the results of this action afterall, sensors and reports coming in as fresh as it is sweet. 

A capsule of cold brewed coffee is chewed and bitter against her posterior third. Her own hands aren't the coldest to work with the tools, lacking the shakiness that would've negated her some part of work. Though there's no desire on that view of such small change, where dictated by human logistics would've been some form of gratitude to these the most minute things. Some sort of prayer to one or a couple gods. 

Theologies; the way that people make sense of the world around them. It can be an interesting subject, if she wanted to pick that back up. 

Not as of late, not as of later either. 

There isn't much of a wardrobe, rather there's clothing hangers wherever she finds the most convenient to put. To nothing that guides, not a plan of touch. Pulling a brown coat over her shoulders, she brushes her streaked hair out, over her coat and ties it up with a pen she found in one of the pockets. 

It's snowing outside. 

One makes sure to shiver at the cold. It is though warmer behind her, the door she closed just moments ago shakes again in her replay. Her what-was warm hands ought to get colder in this weather without gloves. Her knuckles wrinkled, the same tone of skin as the brownstones neighbours she hide in with. 

.



### Deleted scenes.

You do not awake.

It's the blazing fear, dread that shook through your vessel before your demise. Welcome, maybe it's your first time here, maybe you'd imagined this to be much more grander. 

It is still. 

And it gives you some kinds shivers that one cannot realise without organs. Who would blame you, you're you and you've never complained about something as minute as this, as something so unbothering to anyone else. 

What day was it? Ah, right. 

It's Wednesday 14th, you've been meandering down the rivers near its dark waters for two days. 
It's not cold. Even though you'd expected something in that sense. 
.

Not leaving imprints in such a tender environment is impossible, even if you're god. So he simply took what he wanted (evidence) and left little trace (that he's sure no one else would ever find).
