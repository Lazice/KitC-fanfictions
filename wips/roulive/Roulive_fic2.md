Door opens, chattering in the long hallways. Mingling workers lurk their whispers underneath hushed breaths, lowered gazes watch Olive stride through the court's hallways. Holding his head up under their looks, the confidence as the future Diamonds' Ace in his walk. The concrete grounds lay a single path out of the castle, outside into the woods. Two wooden benches either side, day and night, their stomachs to the sky. Blurred were the wooden gates that works by a handman. 

"Could I?" 

_"Name and suit?"_ 

"Olive, Diamond Ace candidate." 

Slowly, the burly handman turns away from it, detaching their gaze off it last as they'd go to unlock. The door swings open with with a creek, the cobble grounds accent the flourishing, cold Autumn.

... They walk through the warm greenery which surrounds them. His hand clutching tightly to the key. To how they pay no mind to the solace as the wind climbs vivid, when the clouds seems just lower to them, than before.

The way the hill rises above, higher than the trees, just slightly higher than the castle beneath. How time steals away from life...

A pale figure stands beneath the looming evergreens. As kir white hair almost glows under the way that the afternoon sunlight glazes kir presence. A calm and still figure. The way that the vibrant cold of winter seems to have came early, the way kir blue eyes meets theirs.

"Sorry for having you come all this way."

They nod, this seemed important for kime. Calmer, less irritated than last week; the isolation from it all did them some good.
> [they seem calm, less generally less irritated than before. The isolation did them some good.]

"Are you alright? Is it about the memorial? "

"I don't think so, no..."

Roulx's wispy white hair is unkempt, its eyes, looking to the side, are glazed over with a shade of exhaustion. Olive leans back on his heels, relaxing for this polite being, patiently. 

> ... It's not the memorial I guess, but I don't think I'll be appearing to that memorial anyways... [Swaying itself, its eyes half opened.] I guess that you'll be fine with me staying over for sometime?...

"... I don't think it's their death. But. I guess I won't be appearing at the memorials."

They fidget with their hands, long, nimble fingers intertwining like a play. As they look to the side then back to Olive. 

"It seems... Would you be fine if I stayed over for sometime?" 

It sways, slower than the wind. Frail under the afternoon light, he responds by his gaze, a nod, he replies. The hand which grasps the key raises to its view.

"You seem in need of a break from.. whatever is happening. It must be a lot."

"Thanks... I'll owe you one after this,, untimely event." 

Roulx takes the key gently by its hands, pinched out from grasp, careful to not touch his own hands. A lost sort of respect. 

"No worries, we've got plenty of space. Come along." 

As the keys to the Diamonds' now has a new accessor, he smiles, taking his steps forwards, he looks back, watching Roulx. Ki looks back, and walks up to beside him. Roulx looks down in a neutral expression, no other expression to return for him, ki kimself have thoughts to attend to.

Olive nods, stepping forwards first to lead them both down the mountain. Roulx seems even pitiful in their current state...

The gate comes back into view of them both. That wooden draw-gate which blocks the whole of what goes behind it. Well they're not going through that one, instead, the smaller one by its right side, a guarding tower's door. Olive walks up first and knocks on the door, Roulx stands by a step back. 

A cateye's hatch opens up top. A familiar pair of eyes make to greet Olive, then seems to widen at the overtly visible figure behind him. 
*"Welcome back Olive and... Roulx."*

"Hello, yes it is us."

"I don't remember you, Roulx sir going out." His pea sized eyes squint even smaller, more cautious at although the brightest candidate in the court. One that the servants would remember to have interacted with.

"... I don't know, my friend please excuse my mishap this time." And Roulx bows their head at him, ever so in a plea. 

Olive himself stands present in front of Roulx, the gateman's gaze looks over him and ponders for,

That he takes a step forward after all, a sort of venom in his tone. “Respectfully. Would you care enough to not misgender my friend here? I believe that you are only humiliating yourself in doing so.    Now please, let them through.” 

The gateman is, taken back by that sharp response from what looked to be two polite gentlemen. Nothing else but to performs his obligation. Leaving the window hatch snapping down their gazes, following by the sound of the turning of the knob of the door. 

When Roulx looks back at Olive for the order of procedure, Olive is looking back at kime, for presumably the same expectant step forwards. Whilst ki wills kimself to initiate either a profile of honest politeness to accompany the person ki stands in front of. The person ki's internally trying for, steps forwards, to the door and looks back to kime again, their gaze which landed calmly. 

They're waiting for kime. They(r) doesn't stop.



The look of the person in white is one of questioning, staring back with its pale blue eyes, tilting their head and stepping forwards to him. 

"Well?" Some the mild tenses of adrenaline wants Olive to hold their hand out to Roulx, lead them as if Olive was a
