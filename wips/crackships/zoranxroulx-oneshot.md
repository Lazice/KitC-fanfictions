# Roulx x Zoran (oneshot)

Zoran flirts with Roulx to see what happens. Roulx falls in explicably in love with this veil monster thing. But ae doesn't feel the same way. Shit happens.

Perhaps just a normal Wednesday afternoon. 
A guestroom, a common room. The spade's couches and lighting is always so cosy, that Roulx would simply attain the permission from the members of the spades suit, just so that it can rest in here ever so often.

The days in the Cards Kingdom are never quiet, never are the solace of this afternoon's dreamy muttering that filters not through the walls.  But with a half read book on their chest, the warm dozy feeling radiating around, Roulx falls to a nice afternoon nap.

What came upon Roulx's view, was them sat calmly upon a wooden bench. In the way that it knows it's waiting for something, or to say, *someone*. And they don't see anything. A wooden bench in the middle of nowhere, not anywhere the sunlight hits, definitely not anywhere that man will exist. 

But they're satisfied. In the sick way that this is their future that they're so sure of. 

To be alone.

...

*How boring.* 
Was the first thing that Zoran thought when ae came upon the dim scenery. Cement ground with small slits in the ground looking cracked But the cracks, gradually growing more severe, all seem to lead aer to a centre source. 

A single wooden bench with a beam of light, dusted and speckled on top of a being sat still like a statue on the bench. If not for their blink and slightly turning towards the person that is steadily approaching them. 

"Heyyy! Sooo what's all this about?"

Ae stands, hopping from one protruding stone plate to another, gracefully falling slow under the light moon-like gravity. Hands folded behind aer back, a show-off at aer heart. Purple coat slowly extending to grow a tail fold behind aer, flowing in mid-air. 

"Waiting."
"Who you waiting for?"
"... I don't know."

Roulx looks downwards into kir hands. The light beam above are shaped by the light veils of dust particle, falling slowly onto kime. Same white hair, haphazardly shorn short to the ears, hair which falls down kir face. A pure white suit that sits so bright and lonely under all the monochromatic of this dream. Under the spotlight, doesn't ki burn? But with a skip, a tight rope juggling time.

"Aww. Are you waiting for me then? Since I'm the only one that arrived."

Zoran's words chuckle like chirps to the dark, early morning. Breaking what's not his.

"What?"

With more a gasp to their words, they look up, questionably so but so innocently curious and strange. Blue irises pure to meet a simple and untellable pair purple. A smile bares the purple eyes, curving up by the middle parts. 

"Well! That's *your* troubles to wonder then."
"No no,, uh. Shit. Please excuse me."
"You are excused~!"

Roulx stands up from its bench, its hands reaching out to him in a daze. And he takes it, shaking it with a gentle grasp.. His left hand is stretched off to the side, relaxed a touch, he taps on the air.

"Nice to meet you Roulx!"

It stutters again in its steps. Where usually in its dreams, it's as wordless as it can be in real life. Meeting people that it doesn't recognise, its words stuck in its throat as real as these people look to be. Yet, it's not happening now. 
"Nice to meet you too. I'm sorry, but I didn't get your name," Roulx asks, a fluent matter of factly.

Hadn't the sky been just a dark grey before? Zoran recalls. Ae looks up, how the clear sky shifts to that of a nice, smooth, light, lime green. 

And they don't move. 

Where there was supposed to be dialogue after the interaction, there was nothing. With it seeming that the two simply suspended in time.
