A Roulx short.

It can't admit to being a bookreader, these that sit around kime with stakes dipped bloody in their hands, certainly don't talk about that. 

Only a certain group of them gather here everytime, set. Few knows what about this dangerous occasion allures them, more knows just that it's enforced. Gathered with swords and pikes over here. They sit in along, covet nothing but their own body and the few their own which were still given to. Some choose to be here. Not Roulx. But more of a sense pervails over its own deny, to accept.
