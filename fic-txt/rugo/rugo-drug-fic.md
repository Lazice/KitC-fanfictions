Hugo was never one to smoke, whether it be cigarettes or marijuana, it never sat well with his lungs. It tasted bad, it burned his paper thin lungs and throat. It made his stomach heave, dry retching and coughing as the nicotine or THC kicked in. He always felt sickly around those who smoked, his throat closing up as he breathed in the second hand smoke. His preferred method of slowly killing himself, you may ask? Pills, powders and anything with high sugar content.

He sat in the bathtub, submerged in hot water speckled with CBD oil. His hair protected from the water, only wishing to wet his body at the moment. Pain thrummed through his legs and back, leg and hips spasming and shaking in the water. It splashed lightly over the deep walls of the tub, landing on the bathmat below. Music played in the background from his shitty phone, something slowed and dazed on Spotify. It added to the atmosphere, one that soon would be complete as soon as Roulx came home from the store. 

The rain pounded down on their shitty little flat, thrashing against the shut windows. The heating cranked high to combat the cold that sunk deep into his bones. The bus stop wasn’t too far away, an easy walk away on a good or bad day. Roulx didn’t drive often and Hugo couldn’t get a licence because of his legs. He looked over at the little waterproof clock on the side of the tub, showing him the time. The next bus should be arriving soon, hopefully with Roulx on it with the food shopping. 

The door clicked open, following the sounds of shuffling bags and keys being tossed in the dish at the door. He tilted his head to hear the quiet footsteps coming towards the bathroom door. It was unlocked, anyone could enter the temporary steam room Hugo turned it into. There stood Roulx after ki closed the door, leaning against it. It was dressed beautifully in a sheer slip dress over a white turtleneck and white slacks. Ki walked closer, kneeling in front of the bath. Ki reached over, brushing a hand through Hugo’s damp curls.

“You look sick,” ki said quietly, their eyes piercing through Hugo’s unshielded eyes. He blinked at them, reaching a wet hand out of the water to cup kir’s face. He leans in for a shaky kiss, awkwardly bumping his face against theirs. 

“Just a flare up. Can you wash my hair?” Hugo’s voice was scratchy and crackly as he talked, having kept quiet almost all of the day. His hair didn’t need to be washed yet, but he might as well get it over and done with. He liked it when Roulx washed his hair, especially when they scratched and massaged his scalp. There was a routine to it, one that he tried to stick to even in his current state. 

“I can,” Roulx replied, murmuring as they rolled their sleeves up. Standing up, they reached for the two-in-one bottle of shampoo and conditioner on the windowsill of the bathroom. It was store brand and meant for dandruff, but it also kept Hugo’s waves luscious and in control. Hugo slid back, knees bent as he dipped his head into the hot water. He hissed as the water came in contact with his upper back, shoulders, neck and scalp. Water rushed through his ears, deafening any outside sounds. He ran his fingers through his hair, making sure it was thoroughly soaked. He slowly sat up, holding the inner handles of the bath to pull himself up. 

Roulx tied their own hair back with the cream coloured scrunchie on their wrist. Ki shook the bottle in kir hand, flicking the cap open. They poured a reasonable amount into the palm of their hand, setting the bottle down to get both hands in his hair. He groaned lowly as Roulx massaged his scalp, massaging the products from root to ends. They took their time, making sure to get everything lathered.

“I got you soup…and those little cakes you like. Even got you some mango puree to put in a smoothie when you can’t eat.” Roulx said, taking in his silence and the music playing from his phone. 

“Wha’ kin’a soup?” He asked, slurring his words slightly. 

“Chicken noodle, the kind you like.” Roulx replied, reaching for the bar of soap in the dish stuck to the wall between the two taps. It dipped it into the water, rubbing it against the damp flannel to produce a lather. He didn’t ask for them to do that, but he didn’t protest. As the shampoo and conditioner soaked in his hair, Roulx carefully washed his body with gentle and firm touches. He leaned into the touch, eyes fluttering shut. 

They shuffled back, rinsing the flannel of soap. They wringed it out, setting it on the side of the bath. Hugo slid back into the water again, washing the suds out with his hands. As he sat up, he squeezed the water out of his hair. He reached into the water, pulling out the plug to drain the water. It was starting to become lukewarm. He shakily got out of the bath, letting Roulx wrap the softest towel they owned around him. He slumped down against the radiator, the heat cranked high to help himself dry off. 

“What do you want to wear?” Roulx sat down across from him, grabbing another towel to dry his legs off. He groaned as a reply, rubbing the back of his head against the radiator.

“...Just a t-shirt and boxers,” He mumbled at last, reaching up to use the towel in Roulx’s hands to dry his hair. “Don’t want to wear much,” 

Roulx trailed their hand up his right leg, gently massaging his knee and thigh. His skin felt damp, smelling like icing sugar, under their hands still warm from the bath. His leg jerked and spasmed in its hands, his face grimacing in pain. 

“I’ll get your painkillers as well,” Roulx let go of his leg, standing up to leave the bathroom. He watched as they walked out, leaving the door slightly ajar to let the steam out. He heard them shuffling about, opening doors and closing them to get what he needed. 

Roulx moved quietly through the apartment, the noise of their neighbours drowned out by the wind and rain. The thin walls contained barely any noise, they could hear everything always. From people practising instruments, to arguing, to sex, to anything humans did in the privacy of their own little bubbles. They picked up the blister packets of pills on Hugo’s bedside table, along with the discarded clothes on the floor. Tight boxer briefs that should’ve been thrown out years ago, holes on the waistband and the colour faded from multiple washes. Roulx didn’t question why Hugo refused to get rid of any of his clothes unless he really had to. His pyjama t-shirt was on the bed, half hanging off and half buried under the duvet. Another ancient thing, far too big for him with a faded print on it. Some rock band Hugo listened to on and off, another vessel to store random facts to ramble about during post sex clarity. 

They shuffled back to the bathroom, half expecting to find Hugo slumped on the floor. He wasn’t, still slumped against the radiator with his glasses back on and scrolling through his phone. He was mostly dry, hair still damp and flopped over to one side. His waves were flatter than usual, but they knew in the morning they’d be wild and untamed. Ki sat down next to Hugo, setting the clothes down next to him. He moved slowly as he got dressed as Roulx hung the towels up. Hauling himself up from the tiled floor, Hugo leaned against the sink to pop out his painkillers from the blister packs. Two of each, drunk with water straight for the tap.

They weren’t the ones he was prescribed, his doctors didn’t really believe his pain but his dealers did. The bitter taste lingered in his mouth as he gestured for Roulx to give him a kiss. Ki tasted sweet, like champagne or some sparkling drink. It balanced out the bitter, acidic taste of Hugo’s leftover painkillers and the sour lemonade he had in the morning. Kir hands rested on his waist, fingers curling gently so as to not leave bruises. His own hands came up to rest on their shoulders, reaching up to pull their hair out from the low ponytail. 

Hands trailed over each other's body, exploring well discovered places over and over again. It was Roulx’s turn to take charge, guiding Hugo to their shared bedroom. He stumbled after them, holding onto them to keep himself up right. Roulx shoved him gently onto the bed, letting him shuffle back to lean against the headboard. He reached behind to adjust the pillows, cushioning his back against the wood. They kneeled between his legs, moving them to wrap around kir waist. Ki leaned forward, placing little kisses along Hugo’s collarbone and the hollow of his throat. 

He squirmed lightly as it kissed his neck, enjoying the pleasant warmth the drugs gave him. It wasn’t hard to turn him on, the right amount of pressure being put in the right places got him hard almost instantly. Roulx had conditioned him well, fueling his burning desire throughout the day with well timed kisses and grasps. His high had heightened the experiences tenfold, making him almost too sensitive to their gentle touches and kisses and nibbles. 

Roulx leaned back to undress, the dress and turtleneck falling to the floor with dull thud. Hugo pulled it down closer to him, hands fumbling with its leather belt and button to their slacks. He slipped his hand into Roulx’s underwear, rubbing the frenulum and glands to get some slick produced. Roulx pushed him back against the pillows, removing their slacks and underwear. Their hands slipped underneath Hugo’s t-shirt to trace his ribs. He arched away from them, curling in on himself. The soft skin felt like silk underneath Roulx’s palms, perfect to be bitten and marred by their tongue and teeth. 

They pulled his t-shirt off, tossing it to the side with the rest of their clothes.
