## - Olive x Roulx  Roulive

The wheel chose this. 
 - Ariel actually had this ship at the back of their mind before the canonical Jade x Olive (Jalive).
 - You wouldn't even have to walk far to get here.
 - Yeah. Okay. I can imagine this.
 

# Olive x Roulx fic.
	Angst and fluff, Olive Stanford (KitC), Roulx Rhymer (KitC), grief, this is a crackship.

It takes a while.

For Roulx, time flows around itself like syrup. Losing track of it was easy. In kir everyday, events are the obstructions to that delicate flowing syrup, of sweeping minutes. And ki would enjoy everytime the syrup would be slowed down. Feeling the world around kime, like finger tips to the wooden smoke and smog. 

Its own mind *is* only "human" afterall.

Which means it has flaws. 
Roulx couldn't've *possibly* stopped what had happened. 

Not with the everything that was going on...

Whispered chatterings and the crackling smoke hung in the air as an ambiance distinct from the deathly news. As Ash, the very murderer sat next door in the guestroom. The twins, one sat above all on the rafters, swung cheerily upside down, as in one their hand wields the sweet smellings of freshly melted smores. Hugo sat beside the campfire, keeping it burning. His silhouette sat dark, but present in the room.

For Roulx, it seemed that the moment that everything came down, was when Luci came in. Not even to be fair, all the hearts candidates seemed to have that aura of intimidation for kime. Or perhaps ki was just too sensitive to that. 

But still, it didn't talk. It did. Nothing.

... The weather bears of soft winds, blue sky. The hill is just far enough away from the castle to not recieve of its commotion, yet not close enough to the town to induce kime of theirs too.

It feels...  'no, not exactly *nice*.'

White, blue glowing stars utter their greetings with their unblinking eyes. Their fixed movements, on their tracks set to the west.

It blinks. Constellations dragged onto their next stations. Lamb ear's grass caress its senses, beneath its white linen suit. Passing by without ever a wait, as if they're rushing for a time better than now.

Hidden within its own view, Roulx tries to reason. That this is but punishment for... For what? For its lack-luster, actionless, coward-like being to be? They have things to do back at the court. The temptation to run away and start another life, burdens to be more than just reckless. It's irresponsible and unfair to its very morals. Or maybe for what, just the mere way, that their very presence, is taking up more space than they'd ever deserv-


### Dawn.

*Light..*

### Dusk.

*Stars...*

...
They don't think too hard about the few birds that'd stopped by, twins quickly disappearing from its recall. 

Its hands are clean, gliding over the shallow blade of grass beside itself... One could even say that this is a way to relax. This *was* intended to be a rest afterall. To make sense of the everything that has came up.
...

The darkness of tonight shouldn't be so suffocating. 

Ki watches the horizon, the horizon watches back without tempt. Alike a bubble. Specks of darkness rises in kir sight, lulling kime to rest out in the deep, empty, opening. 
Venus hill. 

Mornings wears one out. Especially when there's nothing else to do. Ki has to head back. Sure no one will be waiting for kir return, 'there has to be a way.' but that doesn't mean that its lack of presence will make everything better. Only by doing *something*, will change happen. 

A light blue phonecase. If Roulx held it up to the sky, maybe it would blend like a backdrop into the sky. A long list of contacts that seems all so familar. Even if it hadn't talked to all of them, but word by mouth can be a faster way of learning than anyone could imagine. But all to the suits, it wonders if it can stay in any of the other towers. 'would they have any spare? last time i'd slept on the grounds of the spades...' An empty feeling hollows out its senses for a moment. But quickly, it returns to its senses, when its phone screen automatically turns off from the lack of interaction. 

It would be fucking hilarious if Roulx completed the collection of, *towers that it has slept in at least once* -with the Diamonds tower. But that's only a stray thought as they'd glance over his contact name. *Olive*. 

Not too familiar, but also not too unfamiliar. They were there when Roulx passed out the first time, they were cold and unbothering. 'perhaps they would be like kane from the same suit. intimidating. but strange? i don't know enough.'

---

Not too close. Within the Diamond tower guestroom, there sat a working candidate. Sketching away upon his pace at an engineering project. Small metal pieces lay scattered on the desk, rough hands work away, drawing in lines and calculation on a notebook smudged partly with lead. The way his dark curly hair shaved on the sides hung in the air as he worked away.

One would question how he stays so calm during a time of crisis! But you see dear reader, this man is just fucking abnormal. He is having a hyperfixation to distract him from the current political affairs. How irresponsible. 

... But one is not to be judged. He works away and only *one* of his reason is due to there being lately nothing else to do. 

To the right of their wooden workbench, sat their phone facing upwards. 

It's not exactly been quiet lately, but the tension between the candidates have been obvious. Not that they don't wish to participate in it, but just... Well they don't wish to participate in it. Too much chaos isn't good for the composure to keep up.

#### *Ping.*

Their phone screen lights up, 



```

A competition without rules. 

Everyone has been here for how long? The mere month and they've betted their life and saving throws too? **Ridiculous.** 

The waves of panic and fear struck itself so abruptly, their mind and body did the only thing that they *knew* would give them comfort in that very moment. Heading to the hill, hiding away from the rest of the court for however long, it would take for their feeble mind to process through the emotions.

>  ... [1 day.]

They had not moved from their position beneath the tree. When Roulx had awakened from their untimely rest, a dream hollowed out from its desolation, lost itself in its dream. The morning looked up to the branches; the fuzzy green lights filtered through the leaves. Shifting rays, casted down upon its dirty, glasses' lens. The dawn uttered to mourn, their voices circulated rounds in its space. 

*Perhaps I wasn't meant to be here.* Easy for its thoughts to turn to the worst, when there's only itself to hear where the logic lies.

...

'it's quiet again.'

The birdsongs accompany its gaze upwards, unmoving like a corpse. 

> ... [2 days.]

It's untelling of how many times, they'd brinked on the edges of being awake and being asleep. 
The grass on their back cushions them to reality. Still, time ticks.

There are no voices.

The dusk tells it the end of its second day. Pale eyelids droop halfway down, tired as the world blurs in, soothed, uttered for the flow of time. 

It's a humble, yet supposedly desolate escape for kir life. But this as thivery refugee from
